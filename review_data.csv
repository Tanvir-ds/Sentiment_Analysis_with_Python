In previous experiences in Berkeley and LA, it takes over 2 months to get an appointment but I was able to schedule one here for the next week. They had coffee and snacks and my repair was done in 30 min. I didn't catch his name but the person working on my car was a younger asian man with glasses. I am definitely going to look for him next time I have to come in. I had such a hatred for tesla service centers before but now I am glad to know I can rely on this location!!"
1,"Really poor service. I took my car in to get the front passenger door fixed on Monday and was told the part was delivered damaged so I needed to reschedule the appointment for Friday and they would do it via mobile service. So the service center scheduled a 8am-12pm Friday mobile service appointment to get the door fixed. No one showed up, no communication, and no one responded to questions on the mobile app. Finally, at 5pm I got a message that they didn't have the part and that I'll have to reschedule the appointment. Absolutely terrible communication & no proactive work to make sure they don't waste their customers' time."

3,"In a nutshell: Tesla sucks! I leased one of their Model Ys in 2021 and had technical issues within the first month. After a whole year, I had finally gotten them to take the car back and refund the entire year's worth of payments (including down payment & fees). But now, Tesla Insurance is still charging me for month insurance. Worse yet: when I call the 844 number, it's automated system doesn't provide an option for their insurance department... and even when I press any other number for a department, they just leave you on hold listening to some stupid music! I had to call my credit card company to dispute the charge and put a block on them. Do not buy a Tesla, or you'll be stuck in one or all of these terrible situations!"
4,I waited for 25 mins and no one even acknowledged i was in the show room. I walked over to the one salesman who was helping another customer to see if he might at least say hang on or hello. Nothing. I was just down in Colma and will use that one even though I live in the City.
5,Delivery and customer service experience is beyond horrible from Tesla. I've now lost a lot of respect and confidence for Tesla and their cars. They have absolute zero care for their customers and only care about themselves. Not sure if I will ever order another vehicle from Tesla in the future.
6,"I took back my 2018 Model 3 last month for safety recall and error on passenger safety belt, nothing to complain, left the car and pickup the next day with $200 uber credit.The car is beyond satisfying and this location service team is top notch!Thank you team Van Ness!"
7,"Well, I had an issue with my Tesla. Took it into the service center on Thursday. They called me earlier today to tell me to come in and pick up my car and then summarily canceled the Uber voucher that I was given. I'M CURRENTLY ON THE CALTRAIN TO SAVE THEM $ AND NOT USE IT ALL. THEN I WENT TO ORDER A RIDE AND IT SAID CANCELED WOW. Last Tesla I own."
8,"Nick has been amazing in educating us about the Teslas and answering all of our many questions. There's so much information online that it's overwhelming so it's great to talk to someone in person. Plus Nick was just so wonderful, helpful and trustworthy. It made buying our first new car a great experience and we are so thrilled to have our new Tesla soon! Also it's a huuuuuuge relief to not have to spend energy and time negotiating on price and all that."
9,"Classic sales person technique. Text you to confirm meeting then when you show up to test drive, they have nothing to even try.  Anthony was all excited to get me to come in, I confirmed the appointment and no one bothered to let us know they had nothing to test drive. A simple call would have saved us time versus getting a nanny to cover while we went to try the model Y. Best excuse was ""sorry, we are too busy selling cars to msg you"""
